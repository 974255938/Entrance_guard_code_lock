2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell FSM_onehot_State_Current[6]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[1]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[2]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[3]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[4]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[5]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[6]/CLR, FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
